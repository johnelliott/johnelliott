I’m a software engineer in Seattle.

Since 2022 I’ve been volunteering and serving as a board member of [Seattle Community Network](https://seattlecommunitynetwork.org) providing underserved communities in the greater Seattle area high-quality internet access via cellular networks, unlicensed wireless, and fiber.

From 2016-2021 I worked revitalizing and rebuilding thedailybeast.com. Before media I was an engineer at Social Tables—a 3D event planning SASS startup—following my first career as a mechanical engineer working with nuclear submarines.
