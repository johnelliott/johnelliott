Iâ€™m a software engineer in Seattle. I like building things and connecting people.

Since 2022 Iâ€™ve been volunteering and serving as a board member of Seattle Community Network providing underserved communities in the greater Seattle area high-quality internet access via cellular networks, unlicensed wireless, and fiber.

From 2016-2021 I worked revitalizing and rebuilding thedailybeast.com. Before media I was an engineer at Social Tablesâ€”a 3D event planning SASS startupâ€”following my first career as a mechanical engineer working with nuclear submarines.
